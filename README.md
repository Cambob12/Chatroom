#####a simple 1-1 chat room make with python

#to host a chat simply run "gui - Host"

To join use the config editor to change the IP (Default Host port is 9999)

CONFIG EDITOR:

To use simply run the script, you will have a dialog to open config supplied "config.json"

Change the IP to the Hosts IP, Here you can also set the username to whatever you want, 

NOTICE: if changing the port in the config editor be sure to change the port in the HOST script 


V1.0 Notes:
-Currently to change the Port or username for the host you must do this within the script itself otherwise the username will be defaulted to your pcs name

-Im going to add more to the Gui eventually but i first want to work on a way to compile the 2 scripts into one
